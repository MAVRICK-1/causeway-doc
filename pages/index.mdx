## Introduction

Hello! I'm **Rishi Mondal**, a 5th-semester Computer Science student with a strong interest in **AI**, **IoT**, and **cloud** technologies. Currently, I'm working on my **GSoC project** under the University of California's Open Source Program Office (UC OSPO), focusing on **[enhancing and improving the Core Infrastructure and Experience of the Causeway platform](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/wTxAXxEz)**..

## What is Causeway?

**Causeway** is an **Angular tutorial website** designed to provide developers with **practical experience in Angular** through hands-on projects. The platform offers a range of **learning resources**, from **basic to advanced topics**, making it an invaluable tool for developers at all skill levels. **Causeway's goal** is to create an **engaging and interactive learning environment** that not only teaches Angular but also prepares developers to tackle **real-world challenges**.

## About My Project

My project focuses on **modernizing the Causeway platform** by integrating **logging and analytics**, a **learning dashboard**, and **database management modules**, while also preparing it for **open-sourcing**. Key responsibilities include implementing a **user-friendly login system** similar to Notion using **Firebase Authentication**, enhancing the **landing page and UI**, and developing **dashboards** with **Angular Material**. Additionally, I will create **Learn Angular learning guides and tutorials** and automate deployment with **Firebase CI/CD**. The project also involves scripting to **generate guides**, scripting for **changelog generation**, creating a **sample example website** for tutorials, integrating **Firebase Mock** and **local storage**, and adding **comprehensive documentation**.
