![Phase 2](/gifs/phase4.gif)
In `Phase 4`, the focus was on `automating documentation processes` and ensuring that `all documentation related to open source and technical content` was readily available for both users and developers.

## Tasks Completed :
- **Script Generation for Documentation**: Developed scripts that automatically generate `guide.md` and other documentation files related to open source and technical content. These scripts streamline the process of creating and maintaining up-to-date guides, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency across all documentation.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Ensured that the generated documentation covers all key aspects of the platform, including setup instructions, user guides, developer references, and other technical documents. This enhances the accessibility and usability of the platform for all stakeholders.


## Conclusion

In `Phase 4`, our focus was on enhancing the efficiency and consistency of our documentation processes. By developing scripts for automatic generation of `guide.md` and other technical documentation files, we streamlined the creation and maintenance of up-to-date guides. This automation reduced manual effort and ensured uniformity across all documentation.
