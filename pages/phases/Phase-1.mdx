## Phase 1 : Creating Example Website for tutorial

In `Phase 1` of the project, the focus was on `creating an example website` to serve as a tutorial for developers. This website is designed to `demonstrate a range of functionalities` both `frontend` and `backend`, from simple pages to complex implementations, showcasing `practical uses of Angular features`.

## Task Completed :

- **Website Design and Structure :** Developed a responsive and user-friendly layout using Angular and Angular Material.

- **Feature Implementation :** Included a variety of features, from basic pages to advanced functionalities, to illustrate real-world applications of Angular.

- **Data Storage and State Management :**
	- **Complex Firebase Function for Data Storage :** Implemented a complex Firebase function to handle data storage in Firestore. This function ensures that data is securely stored and efficiently retrieved, leveraging Firebase's real-time capabilities. The function is optimized for handling large datasets and ensuring data consistency and integrity across different components of the application.

	- **State Management :**  Utilized Angular's reactive programming techniques, including NgRx, to manage the application state efficiently. This approach helps in maintaining a predictable state, making the application more robust and easier to debug. State management is seamlessly integrated with Firebase, allowing for real-time updates and synchronization of data across different parts of the application.
