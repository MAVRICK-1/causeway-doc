## Phase 2 : Add Documentation, Firebase workflow and Firebase Mock-DB and local storage integration

![Phase 2](/gifs/phase2.gif)

In `Phase 2` of the project, the focus was on `enhancing the platform's functionality` by adding `comprehensive documentation`, `implementing a Firebase workflow for auto-deployment and hosting pull requests (PRs)`, and `integrating Firebase Mock-DB with local storage`. These upgrades are aimed at `streamlining development`, `improving testing`, and `ensuring a seamless user experience`.

## Tasks Completed:

- **User Documentation :** Added detailed user guides and tutorials to help users navigate and utilize the platform effectively.
- **Developer Documentation :** Created in-depth technical documentation, including code comments, API references, and setup instructions for developers.
- **Auto Deployment :** Configured Firebase Hosting to automatically deploy the website whenever changes are pushed to the main branch, ensuring that the latest version is always live.
- **PR Preview Channels :** Set up Firebase to automatically create preview URLs for every pull request, allowing developers and reviewers to see changes in a live environment before merging.
- **CI/CD Integration :** Integrated Firebase with GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process, linking code commits with deployment events seamlessly.
- **Mock-DB Integration :** Integrated Firebase Mock-DB to create a simulated environment for testing, allowing developers to work without impacting the production database.
- **Local Storage Integration :** Implemented local storage to ensure data persistence on the client side, retaining user data across sessions and during offline usage.
- **Data Synchronization :** Developed synchronization logic to update local storage data with Firebase when the application reconnects to the internet, ensuring consistency between the mock environment and live database.
- **Cross-Tab Syncing :** Enabled cross-tab synchronization using local storage events, ensuring that changes in one tab are reflected across others without requiring a page refresh.
