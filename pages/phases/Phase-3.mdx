- **User Details Management :** Developed the functionality to allow users to edit their details seamlessly, improving the overall user experience.
- **Backend Workflow and Interface Development :** Added Firebase backend functionality to support the new login system and user management features. This includes the creation of interfaces and workflows that ensure smooth operation and data handling.
- **Repository :** The code for the example website is available at: [Causeway](https://github.com/tech4good-lab/causeway2)

These enhancements make the `Causeway` platform more secure, user-centric, and efficient, aligning with the goal of providing a top-tier learning experience.
